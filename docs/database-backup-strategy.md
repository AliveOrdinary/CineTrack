# Database Backup Strategy

## Overview

CineTrack implements a comprehensive database backup strategy using Supabase's built-in backup features combined with custom monitoring and recovery procedures. This document outlines our backup approach, recovery procedures, and monitoring practices.

## Backup Architecture

### Supabase Backup Features

**Automatic Daily Backups**
- Supabase automatically creates daily backups of our PostgreSQL database
- Backups are stored securely in Supabase's infrastructure
- Default retention period: 7 days (can be extended on Pro plans)

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**
- Available on Pro plans and above
- Allows recovery to any specific timestamp within the retention period
- Provides granular recovery options for precise data restoration

**Cross-Region Replication**
- Backups are replicated across multiple availability zones
- Ensures backup availability even during regional outages
- Automatic failover capabilities

## Backup Schedule

### Automatic Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Type**: Full database backup
- **Retention**: 7 days (default)
- **Storage**: Encrypted at rest in Supabase infrastructure

### Point-in-Time Recovery
- **Granularity**: Down to the second
- **Retention**: 7 days (matches backup retention)
- **Recovery Window**: Any point within the last 7 days

## Backup Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring
Our backup monitoring system includes:

1. **Health Score Calculation**
   - Monitors backup success/failure rates
   - Checks backup recency (< 24 hours)
   - Validates PITR availability
   - Assesses retention policy adequacy

2. **Real-time Status Checks**
   - Database connectivity validation
   - Critical table existence verification
   - Backup integrity assessment

3. **Development Monitoring**
   - Visual backup status widget (development only)
   - Console logging of backup health
   - Automated recommendations

### Monitoring Components

**DatabaseBackupManager Class**
```typescript
// Monitor backup status and generate reports
const manager = new DatabaseBackupManager(
  supabaseUrl,
  supabaseKey,
  projectId
);

const report = await manager.generateBackupReport();
```

**BackupMonitor Utilities**
```typescript
// Log backup status in development
BackupMonitor.logBackupStatus();

// Format reports for human consumption
const formattedReport = BackupMonitor.formatReport(report);
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Emergency Recovery Steps

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Determine the scope of data loss
   - Identify the last known good state
   - Estimate recovery time requirements

2. **Access Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Select the CineTrack project
   - Go to Settings → Database → Backups

3. **Choose Recovery Method**

   **Option A: Point-in-Time Recovery**
   - Select specific timestamp for recovery
   - Best for recent data corruption
   - Minimal data loss

   **Option B: Full Backup Restoration**
   - Restore from daily backup
   - Use when PITR is not available
   - May lose up to 24 hours of data

4. **Execute Recovery**
   - Create new project or restore to existing
   - Update environment variables if needed
   - Run database migrations if required

5. **Validate Recovery**
   - Test database connectivity
   - Verify critical table data
   - Check application functionality
   - Validate user authentication

6. **Update Configuration**
   - Update DNS settings if necessary
   - Modify deployment configuration
   - Notify stakeholders of recovery completion

### Recovery Testing

**Monthly Recovery Tests**
- Test PITR on staging environment
- Validate backup restoration procedures
- Document any issues or improvements needed

**Quarterly Full Recovery Drills**
- Complete end-to-end recovery simulation
- Test all recovery procedures
- Update documentation based on findings

## Critical Tables Backup Priority

### High Priority (Core Data)
1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
2. **watched_content** - User viewing history
3. **reviews** - User-generated reviews
4. **custom_lists** - User-created lists
5. **watchlist** - User watchlists

### Medium Priority (Social Data)
6. **follows** - User relationships
7. **notifications** - User notifications
8. **review_interactions** - Likes and comments

### Low Priority (Tracking Data)
9. **episode_tracking** - TV episode progress
10. **activity_feed** - User activity logs

## Backup Security

### Encryption
- All backups encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Encryption keys managed by Supabase
- Secure key rotation policies

### Access Control
- Backup access restricted to project administrators
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Audit logging for all backup operations

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant backup procedures
- Data retention policies enforced
- Right to erasure supported

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- **Critical Systems**: 4 hours
- **Full Application**: 8 hours
- **Complete Data Recovery**: 24 hours

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: 0 minutes
- **Daily Backup Recovery**: 24 hours
- **Acceptable Data Loss**: < 1 hour

## Backup Validation

### Automated Checks
- Daily backup completion verification
- Database connectivity testing
- Critical table existence validation
- Backup file integrity checks

### Manual Validation
- Weekly backup report review
- Monthly recovery test execution
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills

### Validation Checklist
```
□ Verify backup completion notifications
□ Test point-in-time recovery on staging
□ Validate critical table data integrity
□ Check backup file accessibility
□ Test restoration procedure documentation
□ Verify RLS policies after restoration
□ Test application functionality post-recovery
□ Validate user authentication after restore
□ Check data consistency across related tables
□ Verify file storage links and uploads
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Health Metrics
- Backup success rate (target: 99.9%)
- Backup completion time (target: < 30 minutes)
- Recovery test success rate (target: 100%)
- Time since last successful backup (alert: > 25 hours)

### Alert Conditions
- Backup failure
- Backup older than 25 hours
- PITR unavailable
- Database connectivity issues
- Critical table missing

### Notification Channels
- Email alerts to development team
- Slack notifications for critical issues
- Dashboard warnings for degraded service

## Backup Costs and Optimization

### Cost Considerations
- Backup storage costs scale with database size
- Extended retention periods increase costs
- Cross-region replication adds overhead

### Optimization Strategies
- Regular data archival for old records
- Compression of backup data
- Selective backup of critical tables only
- Automated cleanup of expired backups

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Requirements
- Backup operation logging
- Recovery procedure documentation
- Regular compliance reviews
- Third-party security assessments

### Documentation Requirements
- Backup procedure documentation
- Recovery runbooks
- Incident response procedures
- Regular backup reports

## Future Improvements

- Implement automated backup health alerts
- Create backup dashboard for monitoring
- Enhance recovery testing automation

### Medium Term (Next 6 Months)
- Implement cross-region backup replication
- Add backup encryption key rotation
- Create self-service recovery tools

### Long Term (Next Year)
